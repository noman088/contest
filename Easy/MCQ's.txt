Ans= b (==)

iii.	 In object-oriented programming, what is an "object"?
a.	A block of code             (   )  
b.	A reserved word            (   ) 
c.	An instance of a class   (    ) 
d.	A data type                    (   )

Ans. c (instance of a class)

iv.	What is the primary purpose of using function in programming?
a.	To store data                  (   )                    c. To create loops                    (    )   
b.	To declare variables       (   )                   d. To organize and reuse code (    )

Ans. - To organize and reuse code

v.	In Programming  what is a conditional statement used for?
a.	To declare function (   ) 
b.	To execute a block of code only if a certain condition is met (  ) 
c.	To define variables (   ) 
d.	To create arrays  (   )

Ans. - (b) to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is met

vi.	Which of the following is an example of a reserved word in programming?
a.	Variable   (   )     c. Function  (   ) 
b.	if             (   )     d. loop         (   ) 

Ans. -(b) if 

vii.	What is the purpose of an  “  array  ’’ in programming?
a.	To store a single value                                          (   )               
b.	To perform mathematical calculation                   (   ) 
c.	To  store multiple values of different data types  (   ) 
d.	To store multiple values of same data types         (   ) 

Ans. - (c) To store multiple values of same data types

viii.	Break is used in ?
a.	Everywhere                 (   )         c. In only  function (   )  
b.	Only loop and switch  (   )         d. Only loop            (   ) 

Ans. -(b) Only loop and switch


ix.	Find the output of following code:
int main(){
int x=058;
printf("%d",x);
return 0;
}
a.	0  (  )       b. 058  (   )   c . error   (  )   d. None of these(  )

Ans. - error (when we assign any integer value which start with 0 the compiler of c suppose it as a octal number(0-7) .we have 8 which is not in octal number that's why it is an error)


int main()
   {
   int x;
   for(x= -1;x<=10;x++)
   {
If(x<5)
   continue;
else
   break;
printf(“ASCT”);
}
 return 0;
                     }
x.	How many times ASCT  will  print ?
a.	0     (  )             b. 11     (   )	         c. generate Error (   )                d.  10   (   ) 

Ans. - 0 
reason :- untill x=4 the if condition is execute and continue increase the value of x but when x = 5 then if condition is false and else condition will execute and  cursor will break loop and terminate the program that's why printf function will not execute once.
